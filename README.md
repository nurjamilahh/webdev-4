## Introduction

This project, **Milestone 2: Interactive Website**, serves as the foundational online presence for a fictional gaming company named RevoFun. The primary goal was to create an engaging and visually appealing landing page that not only introduces the company brand but also seamlessly hosts several simple, browser-based JavaScript games.

The platform is designed for casual gamers, focusing on a fun, intuitive user experience and showcasing strong front-end development, particularly in JavaScript implementation for interactive gameplay.

## Features Implemented

### 🏡Core Landing Page
* **Company Introduction**: A compelling homepage introducing the RevoFun brand and mission.
* **Game Directory**: A brief overview and directory of all available games.
* **Responsive Navigation**: A clear and intuitive navigation menu linking directly to individual game pages.

### 🕹️ Interactive Games
The RevoFun Gaming Hub features a minimum of three fully implemented, browser-based JavaScript games, each hosted on a dedicated page to provide a focused and engaging experience.

* **Number Guessing Game:** This classic game challenges the player to guess a random number selected by the computer (e.g., between 1-100). The game provides immediate feedback ("Too high" or "Too low") to guide the player, who is limited to five attempts to successfully find the correct number.
* **Rock, Paper, Scissors:** A digitized version of the beloved hand game, where the player competes against a random choice made by the computer. The game determines the winner based on the classic rules and keeps track of the match scores.
* **Clicker Game:** This quick and addictive game presents a large button, requiring players to click it as rapidly as possible within a set time limit. Upon expiration of the timer, the player's final click score is displayed.
* **Cosmic Dodge (Falling Objects) Game:** A fast-paced, action-based game where the player controls a ship/character to avoid randomly generated objects (e.g., meteors or space debris) that fall from the top of the screen. The goal is to survive as long as possible while the game increases in speed and difficulty.

### ✨ User Experience & Optional Features
* **Game Instructions:** Clear, concise instructions are provided on each dedicated game page.
* **Seamless Navigation:** A dedicated "Back to Home" button on every game page.
* **High Scores:** High scores and user nicknames are persisted using localStorage, creating a simple leaderboard experience.

## Technology Stack

This project was built using core web development technologies, focusing on foundational front-end skills:
* **HTML5:** Used for structuring the content, ensuring semantic and accessible markup.
* **CSS3:** Used for styling, layout, visual appeal, and ensuring responsiveness across different devices.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Used minimally for styling the footer section, providing utility-first classes to optimize rapid layout development for that specific component.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** The primary language used to handle all game logic, interactivity, DOM manipulation, and user input.
* **Google Fonts & Font Awesome:** for typography and icons.
* **Deployment:** GitHub Pages.
